# Cryptography for Dummies
Become familiar with cryptography

## Task 1: Intro
**I understand why cryptography is important!**

> No answer needed

## Task 2: Types of cryptography
**What type of cryptography is more secure?**

Symmetric cryptography is faster than asymmetric, but asymmetric is more secure.

> Asymmetric

**What type of cryptography is faster?**

> Symmetric

**What type of cryptography will a Bank site use?**

> Asymmetric

**What will you use to encrypt your messages in asymmetric cryptography?**

> public key

**What will you use to decrypt messages in asymmetric cryptography?**

> private key

**Does symmetric cryptography use two different keys for encryption/decryption? (aye/nay)**

Asymmetric cryptography use two different keys for encryption/decryption.

> nay

## Task 3: What is a hash?
**I understand what are hashes!**

> No answer needed

**What's the MD5 hash of "hashes are cool"?**

Using [MD5 Hash Generator Online Tool](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/), we can generate MD5 hash of any text.

**What does MD5 stand for?**

> Message Digest 5

**Who created MD5?**

> Ronald Rivest

## Task 4:  Decoding/encoding
**Encode the string "cryptographyisuseful" with Base64**

Using [Base64 Encode Online Tool](https://www.base64encode.org/), we can encode a string to Base64.

**Decode the string "dGhlIHNlY3JldCB3b3JkIGlzIDogd2F0ZXJtZWxvbg==". What's the secret word?**

Using [Base64 Decode Online Tool](https://www.base64decode.org/), we can decode Base64 to a string. We found the string "the secret word is : watermelon".

> watermelon
